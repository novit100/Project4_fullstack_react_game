# Game web app using React

<br> **Game system "100 to Get":** <br> 
• Management system and execution of actions in "100 to Get" games by players operating in a circular round.<br> 
• When the application is activated, a serial process of registering all the players who wish to play in the system will be carried out.<br> 
• At the end of the stage of registering all the players to the system - move to the stage of performing actions in the games.<br> 
• During the games - all the boards of the players registered to the system appear simultaneously on the application screen.<br> 
• At any moment - only one player's board is active (according to a round robin), the rest of the players' boards are disabled.<br> 
• An active player can only take one step in his game, then the turn goes to the next player after him.<br> 
•"100 to Get" game for each player starts with a random number between 0 and .99 <br> 
• The goal in every "100 to Get" game is to reach the number 100 in a small number of actions. <br> 
• The actions in the game - +1 (add one), -1 (subtract one), *2 (multiply by two), /2 (divide by two). <br> 
• At the end of each game (reaching 100) - the result (number of actions) of the player is recorded. <br> 
• At the end of each game (reaching 100) - the player can start a new game or leave the system. <br> 
• When a player leaves the system (at the end of his particular game) - his game board is deleted from the system. <br> 
• For each player in the system, a record of the results of all the games he has played so far is saved and displayed personally. <br> 
• The system also includes a central board that displays the top three players according to their game data. <br> 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Getting Started with Create React App
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
